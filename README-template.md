## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [IP Geolocation API](https://geo.ipify.org/)
- [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/)
- [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)

### What I learned

I'm glad to have gained the experience of using open source libraries such as LeafletJS and React Leaflet to incorporate maps into my React app. I also learned about the difference between IPv4 and IPv6 address how to use regular expressions to validate ip them. Additionally, using LeafletJS and React Leaflet was challenging but a worthwhile learning experience.
